# Diary

## Week 1
### Overview
Firstly, I have to work on AMD machines on Grid'5000 (neowise from the Lyon site) and redoing the NEST paper experience on them.

### Done
- Master tools (grid5000, scripts, linux kernel configuration and makefile)
- Read NEST paper : OS Scheduling with Nest: Keeping Tasks Close Together on Warm Cores (https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03612592/)
- Read papers and documentation about AMD Zen 2 architecture
- Run a few benchmarks from the NEST experience on the AMD machines and studied the results
- Design a personal benchmark to run specific experiences to study AMD Zen 2 features
