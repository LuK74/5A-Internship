## Subject
Understanding scheduling overheads and their performance impact in KVM
Whisper team, Inria Paris, 2 rue Simone IFF, 75102 Paris
March 21, 2022 - September 22, 2022

Today, virtualization is commonly used in production environments to support application execution.
In a virtual environment, an underlying hypervisor provides uniform access to the underlying hardware features, allowing the user to install any operating system (known as the guest operating system) that fits the needs of their application.  This approach offers safety, predictability, and flexibility. Nevertheless, it may also incur inefficiencies.
Indeed, the guest operating system may make poor decisions, because its view of the hardware and the overall system load is limited to the information provided by the hypervisor.

The goal of this internship is to examine the consequences of this gap between the guest operating and the machine in the context of process scheduling.
Building on the expertise in Linux kernel process scheduling in the Whisper team, We will design and carry out experiments to precisely understand the challenges facing the process scheduler in a virtualized environment and the impact of these challenges on application performance.
In this, we will study the behavior of a wide range of applications found in the Phoronix benchmark suite, on a wide range of multicore servers, found in both the Whisper team and the Grid 5000 platform.

The internship will be supervised by Julia Lawall (DR1, Inria-Paris), in collaboration with Himadri Pandya (PhD student, Inria-Paris) and Jean-Pierre Lozi (researcher, Oracle).
